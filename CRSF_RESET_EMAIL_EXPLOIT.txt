Password reset broken logic
-> REQ: Personal user/login and Attackers user-name
-> OBJ: Find the other users password, if we know their username. 

--> TURN ZAP ON, AND RESET PASSWORD USING PERSONAL INFO (GO TO EMAIL, AND CONFIRM PASSWORD RESET)

-> ONCE PASSWORD IS RESET, LOOK FOR [POST] RESPONSE IN ZAP FOR THE [RESET PASSWORD HEADER]. 

--> [TEST RESET PASSWORD HEADER]: USING ZAP, CLEAR THE RESET TOKEN ON TOP OF THE HEADER, AND AS THE PARAMATERS BELOW.
	-> HIT [SEND]--> 200 OR 302 RESPONSE MEANS THEY ARE OPEN TO CRSF, AS I CAN MANIPULATE THE HEADER FOR FURTHER REQUESTS.  

-> WHILE LOGGED IN WITH PERSONAL ACCOUNT, GO BACK TO THE [RESET PASSWORD] PAGE, AND RESET PASSWORD AGAIN (GO TO EMAIL, AND CONFIRM PASSWORD RESET) AND GO BACK TO HOME PAGE 

--> SEARCH FOR MOST RECENT POST REQUEST FOR [PASSWORD REST HEADER], AND CHANGE HEADER REQUEST:
	--> DELETE TOKENS (ON TOP OF HEADER, AND AS PARAMATERS)
	--> ADD EXPLOITED USER-NAME IN PARAMATERS, WITH THE PASSWORDS LAST VALID CHANGED FROM PERSONAL ACCOUNT  

--> GO BACK TO LOGIN PAGE, AND USE EXPLOITED USERNAME WITH PREVIOUSLY CREATED PASSWORDS TO LOGIN.
