# Network Protocol

## What is network protocol?

_Protocol is a set of rules which are used in digital communication to connect network devices and exchange information between them._

_`Host` is anything that sends or receive traffic on internet_

### Every host needs four items for internet connectivity

- _`IP Address` : Host identification on the internet_
- _`Subnet Mask` : Size of host network(On same network)_
- _`Default Gateway` : Routers IP address(On other network)_
- _`DNS Server (IP)` : Translate domain name into IP_

#### DHCP `Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol`

_DHCP Server provides IP, SM, DG, DNS for client._

- _SMTP(`Simple Mail Transfer Protocol`)_
- _POP(`Post Office Protocol`)_
- _IMAP(`Internet Messaging Access Protocol`)_
- _UDP(`User Datagram Protocol`)_
- _PPP(`Point-to-Point Protocol`)_

- _SSL/TLS(`Secure Sockets Layer/Transfer Layer Security`)_

## Explanation

## TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)

_TCP/IP is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. It is fundamental for internet operations._

- **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**: _Ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data. It divides data into packets and ensures that all packets are received and correctly assembled at the destination._
- **Internet Protocol (IP)**: _Handles the routing and addressing of packets so they can travel across networks and reach the correct destination._

**Real-Life Example**: _When you visit a website, your browser uses TCP/IP to request and receive web pages from the server. TCP ensures the data is complete and correctly ordered, while IP handles routing the data to your device._

## HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

_HTTP is used for transferring hypertext requests and information on the internet. It is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web._

**Real-Life Example**: _When you type a URL into your browser's address bar and press Enter, your browser uses HTTP to request the webpage from a web server. The server then responds with the webpage data._

## SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

_SMTP is used for sending emails from a client to a server or between servers. It is essential for email communication._

**Real-Life Example**: _When you send an email from your email client (like Outlook or Gmail), SMTP is used to transmit the email message to the email server, which then forwards it to the recipient's email server._

## POP (Post Office Protocol)

_POP is used by email clients to retrieve emails from a server. It downloads emails to the local device, where they are stored and accessed._

**Real-Life Example**: _If you use an email client on your computer to check your emails, POP downloads the emails from the mail server to your local device, so you can read them offline._

## IMAP (Internet Messaging Access Protocol)

_IMAP allows email clients to access and manage emails on a mail server. It keeps emails on the server and enables multiple devices to access the same mailbox._

**Real-Life Example**: _If you check your email from your phone, tablet, and computer, IMAP ensures that all your devices can access and sync your emails in real-time._

## UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

_UDP is a connectionless protocol used for applications that require fast, efficient data transmission without the overhead of error-checking._

**Real-Life Example**: _Online gaming and video streaming services often use UDP because they need to transmit data quickly and can tolerate some loss of data packets, such as minor glitches in video playback or gaming._

## PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)

_PPP is used to establish a direct connection between two nodes in a network, typically for dial-up connections._

**Real-Life Example**: _When you used to connect to the internet via a dial-up modem, PPP was used to establish a connection between your computer and the Internet Service Provider (ISP)._

## FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

_FTP is used for transferring files between a client and a server. It supports both upload and download operations and provides a way to manage files on a remote server._

**Real-Life Example**: _If you upload files to a website's server for content management or download files from a server for backup, FTP is often used to transfer these files._
