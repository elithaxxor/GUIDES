Run aircrack_server.sh on the machine on which you want to crack passwords. This script builds aircrack_client.sh file, which can be executed on any Linux host that is able to connect with the server started earlier. Upon execution, the client automatically captures handshakes, connects with the server and sends captured data.

Whenever a password is sucessfully cracked by the server, the watcher.sh script prints it out to terminal on the server side.

The only required option flag for airstrike_client.sh is the -w flag: it specifies the wordlist that should be used by the server. Listening interface can be specified with -i flag. By default, a current wireless interface is automatically selected. Additionally, airstrike_client.sh listens for WPA-2 data without any filter, so it will capture and crack all of the passwords of all Wi-Fi networks in range (whenever handshakes are exchanged).
